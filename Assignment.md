## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

### 1. Concept: Branching

**Expectation ðŸ‘€**: I thought branching was only necessary when working on large codebases with multiple developers.

**Reality ðŸ˜…**: I discovered that branches are essential even for solo projects. They help isolate new features and prevent accidental bugs in the main code.

**Impact ðŸ’¡**: I created separate feature branches for each issue and merged them back safely. This allowed smooth development and version control across different portfolio sections.



### 2. Concept: Commit Messages

**Expectation ðŸ‘€**: I assumed any message was fine, as long as I remembered what it was about.

**Reality ðŸ˜…**: Structured commit messages actually make it easier to track changes, understand progress and even automatically close issues.

**Impact ðŸ’¡**: I followed the `type(scope): message` format for commits, like `feat: added hero section`. It made my Git history clean, informative, and professional.



### 3. Concept: Pull Requests

**Expectation ðŸ‘€**: I thought pull requests were only useful for teams to review each other's work.

**Reality ðŸ˜…**: Turns out, even for solo projects, PRs help simulate teamwork and allow me to catch issues before merging.

**Impact ðŸ’¡**: I opened pull requests for each feature, reviewed changes and documented merge actions. It gave me hands-on experience with collaborative workflows.



### 4. Concept: Merge Conflicts

**Expectation ðŸ‘€**: I expected merge conflicts to be rare and impossible to simulate intentionally.

**Reality ðŸ˜…**: I learned how to deliberately cause and resolve merge conflicts, which gave me confidence to handle them when they actually occur.

**Impact ðŸ’¡**: I successfully resolved a conflict between two branches that changed the same paragraph in `index.html`. It was a valuable learning experience for real-world scenarios.
